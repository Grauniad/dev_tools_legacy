/*
 * === Intoduction ===
 *   In order to be able to be able to unpack an unknown number of 
 *   elements from the tuple, we need to some how loop over:
 *       f(std::get<I>(tuple),std::get<I-1>(tuple),...);
 *   
 *   To do this with the unpacking operator we need I to be a pack 
 *   which is the same legnth as the tuple, that way when we can do this:
 *       f(std::get<I>(tuple)...);
 *   I will be unpacked, and each item will be passed as an argument.
 *
 * === Getting the packed sequence numbers ===
 *   We can trivially get the size of the tuple (sizeof...(t)) but this only
 *   gives us a scalar. 
 *   
 *   The trick is to allow the compiler's type deduction to build the integer 
 *   pack for us: 
 *      gen_seq<5>::type;  
 *      // compiler must now build the inheritance tree:
 *      // gen_seq<5> => gen_seq<4,4> => gen_seq<3,3,4> => gen_seq(2,2,3,4) 
 *      //   => gen_seq(1,1,2,3,4) => gen_seq(0,0,1,2,3,4)
 *
 * === Passing the integer pack ====
 *   Although we have now built the integer type its stuck in a template parameter. 
 *   To extract we construct a dummy object, the "Sequence", and pass it to the function
 *   which is interested in the pack. It can then ignore the Sequence, but use it's
 *   type integer pack...
 *    
 * Based on the stack-overflow thread here: 
 *    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7858817/unpacking-a-tuple-to-call-a-matching-function-pointer
